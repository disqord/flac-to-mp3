# flac-to-mp3
Bash script that pipes flac to lame

This is my first bash script.

It converts all FLAC files in current folder into mp3 files that are put in a new folder with (hopefully) an appropriate name.

This version can be used for easy integration in Thunar file manager:
  command: bash /PATH/TO/SCRIPT/flac2mp3.sh
  pattern: * , selection: directories
